# Prolog-Implementation-in-Common-Lisp

A Common Lisp program such that when a parsed list of Horn clauses is given (as defined assignment file) as input, it answers all the queries in this list of clauses.
Resolution and unification methods are used to prove the queries and return the list of values for all variables for which the query is true. 
An empty list on return means that the query is false. 

You can check assignment file and report for more details and sample input/output.
